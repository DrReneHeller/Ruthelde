2021_06_24 - V3.1.1

    - Added "MakeGAFromTarget" and "Save GA"
    - Added LastFolder functionality to all Plots and Load/Save events
    - Added some more separators in menu
    - Removed Debug outputs

2021_12_22 - V5.0

    - Introduced *Default_EA_Inputs.json* were the default values for EA input are stored in
      This requires that a corresponding file exists in root folder

    - Increased number of Fitness values and number of fit parameters being tracked (and stored) from 1.000 to 10.000

2022_01_20 - V6.0

    - Changed Fit-routine from EA to DE

    - Changed input format for fit parameters accordingly (four parameters remain: N, F, CR, THR)

        N   - population size [default = 20]
        F   - mutation parameter [default = 0.6]
        CR  - cross over parameter [default = 0.85]
        THR - threshold for population diversity repair [default = 0.98]

        THR is the fraction of average fitness to best fitness at which part (5%) of the population is
        replaced by random individuals in order to get rid of sticking in limited gene pool.

    - Fixed error in reading in simulation file (some parameters were not correctly read since last update)
    - Re-implemented "Make EA constrains" to have now all EA inputs included
    - Added fitness to parameter-output-file (stored value is actual fitness value divided by 100)


2022_01_31 - V6.1

    - Removed injection of best solution temporarily

2022_02_07 - V7.1

    - Refactored the structure of input data: target constrains are now part of the target model, experimental
      constrains part of the experimental setup. What remains from original DE constrain is now only the actual DE
      settings (N, F, CR, THR, ch_min, ch_max, binning) and stop conditions (end time, end fitness, end generation).
    - Removed the "Load Input-File" item --> All data is now handled exclusively over simulation files.
    - Re-factored the DE parameter configurator
    - Re-named couple of menu items and window names
    - Removed Log in fitness calculation
    - Console mode now requires a IBA_SIM file as input
    - Included file type "IBA_SIM" in console mode
    - typing "java -jar IBA.jar help" prints instruction of usage to console
    - DE fit results (fit parameters) are not any longer scaled down to 0...1, neither it is done for fitness value
    - DE status text shows now at the bottom if (and which) any parameter is clipping
    - Internal code review and minor fixes

2022_02_14 - V7.2

    - Fixed error in normalization of elemental ratios
    - Fixed export of data into parameter file and batch-report file
    - Fixed error in scaling of calibration factor during binning
    - Calibration factor in status window now independent on binning
    - increased precession of atomic ratios to 4 in status window
    - Change clipping detection mechanism to start warning already when 90% of para-interval is reached
    - Polished DE status display

2022_02_18 - V7.3

    - Implemented normalization routine for all individuals
